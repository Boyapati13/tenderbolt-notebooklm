## 🔧 How It Works

### Two-Layer Filtering:

**Layer 1: AI Prompt**
- Tells AI to extract ONLY tender submission deadline
- Explicitly says to ignore project timelines

**Layer 2: Post-Processing** (NEW!)
- Searches for "submission" keyword in the extracted dates
- Takes ONLY that date
- Removes any extra labels like "Deadline for Submission of Tenders:"
- Returns clean date: "22nd October 2025 09:30"

## 📋 Example Flow

### Input (From PDF):
```
Deadline for request for additional information: 5th October 2025 09:30 CEST
Deadline for Submission of Tenders: 22nd October 2025 09:30 CEST
Tender Opening Session: 22nd October 2025 10:00 CEST
Implementation: sixteen (16) months from contract signing
...
```

### AI Extracts:
```json
{
  "deadlines": [
    "Deadline for Submission of Tenders: 22nd October 2025 09:30 CEST"
  ]
}
```

### Post-Processing Cleans:
```
22nd October 2025 09:30 CEST
```

### Final Display:
```
╔════════════════════════════════╗
║  🤖 AI EXTRACTED              ║
║                                ║
║  SUBMISSION DEADLINE          ║
║  22nd October 2025 09:30 CEST ║
╚════════════════════════════════╝
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Code Location:
`src/lib/auto-extract.ts` - lines 56-77

### Logic:
1. Check if deadlines array exists
2. Find deadline containing "submission" keyword
3. Clean up the text (remove labels)
4. Return only that one clean date

### Fallback:
If "submission" keyword not found, takes the first date (usually the most important one)
