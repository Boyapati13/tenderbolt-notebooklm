# Custom Report Requirements Field - Example

## New Feature Added
The custom report creation now includes a **"What I Need from This Report"** field that allows you to specify exactly what you want the report to provide.

## How It Works

### 1. **Requirements Field**
- **Location**: In the custom report modal, after the description field
- **Required**: Yes (marked with asterisk *)
- **Purpose**: Tell the AI exactly what you need from the report

### 2. **AI Integration**
- The AI uses your requirements to focus the content generation
- Ensures the report directly addresses what you're looking for
- Prioritizes your specific needs over generic content

## Example Requirements

### **Technical Analysis Report**
**What I Need from This Report:**
```
- Detailed analysis of technical requirements and our capability to meet them
- Specific technology recommendations and implementation approach
- Resource requirements and team structure needed
- Timeline estimates for each phase of development
- Risk assessment for technical challenges and mitigation strategies
- Cost breakdown for technical implementation
```

### **Executive Decision Brief**
**What I Need from This Report:**
```
- Clear recommendation on whether to pursue this opportunity

- Key decision factors and critical success metrics
```

```

### **Risk Assessment Report**

```

## Benefits

### **Targeted Content**
- AI generates content specifically for your needs
- No generic information that doesn't help you
- Focuses on actionable insights and recommendations

### **Better Decision Making**
- Reports directly address your decision-making needs
- Provides specific information you can act on
- Saves time by avoiding irrelevant content

### **Customized Analysis**
- Each report is tailored to your specific situation
- Considers your unique requirements and context
- Provides relevant recommendations for your use case

## Best Practices

### **Be Specific**
- Instead of "analysis", specify "cost analysis with budget recommendations"
- Instead of "risks", specify "technical risks with mitigation strategies"
- Instead of "timeline", specify "project timeline with resource allocation"

### **Include Context**
- Mention your role (e.g., "as a project manager, I need...")
- Specify the decision you're trying to make
- Include any constraints or considerations

### **Use Action Words**
- "I need recommendations on..."
- "I want to understand..."
- "I need to know how to..."
- "I need to assess..."

### **Examples of Good Requirements**
✅ **Good**: "I need a detailed cost breakdown with labor, materials, and overhead costs, plus recommendations for cost optimization"

❌ **Poor**: "I need cost information"

✅ **Good**: "As a technical lead, I need to understand the implementation challenges and resource requirements for this project"

❌ **Poor**: "I need technical information"

## Testing the Feature

1. **Create a Custom Report**
   - Click "Create Custom Report" button
   - Fill in the title and description
   - **Fill in the "What I Need from This Report" field with specific requirements**

2. **Generate the Report**
   - The AI will use your requirements to focus the content
   - Review how well the generated content addresses your specific needs

3. **Iterate and Improve**
   - If the content doesn't meet your needs, try being more specific in the requirements
   - Add more context about your role and decision-making needs

The requirements field ensures that every custom report is specifically tailored to what you actually need, making the reports much more valuable and actionable for your specific situation.
