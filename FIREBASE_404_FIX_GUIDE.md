# 🔧 Firebase 404 Error Fix Guide

## Problem Identified
You're getting 404 errors when deploying to Firebase because:
1. Next.js dynamic routes don't work with static export
2. API routes are not available in static export
3. Firebase hosting needs proper rewrites for SPA routing

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Firebase Configuration (`firebase.json`)
- Added proper rewrites for all routes
- Configured static file caching
- Set up fallback to 404.html

### 2. Enhanced Next.js Config (`.next.config.firebase.js`)
- Optimized for static export
- Disabled server-side features
- Added proper distDir configuration

### 3. Created Firebase Build Script (`build-firebase.js`)
- Automated build process
- Verifies output directory
- Creates missing 404.html

### 4. Added NPM Scripts
- `npm run build:firebase` - Build for Firebase
- `npm run deploy:firebase` - Build and deploy

## 🚀 How to Fix and Deploy

### Step 1: Build for Firebase
```bash
npm run build:firebase
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Firebase
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Alternative: One-Command Deploy
```bash
npm run deploy:firebase
```

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Firebase Hosting Rewrites
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/en/studio",
      "destination": "/en/studio/index.html"
    },
    {
      "source": "/en/studio/**",
      "destination": "/en/studio/index.html"
    },
    {
      "source": "/en/dashboard",
      "destination": "/en/dashboard/index.html"
    },
    {
      "source": "/en/dashboard/**",
      "destination": "/en/dashboard/index.html"
    },
    {
      "source": "/",
      "destination": "/en/index.html"
    },
    {
      "source": "**",
      "destination": "/404.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Next.js Static Export Config
```javascript
{
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  distDir: 'out',
  images: { unoptimized: true },
  // Disabled server-side features
}
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these URLs:
- [ ] `https://your-project-id.web.app/` → Redirects to `/en`
- [ ] `https://your-project-id.web.app/en/dashboard` → Dashboard loads
- [ ] `https://your-project-id.web.app/en/studio` → Studio loads
- [ ] `https://your-project-id.web.app/en/studio?tenderId=tender_004` → Studio with tender
- [ ] `https://your-project-id.web.app/en/studio?tenderId=tender_004&tool=audio-overview` → Audio Overview
- [ ] `https://your-project-id.web.app/nonexistent` → 404 page

## 🎯 Audio Overview Access

### Method 1: Direct URL
```
https://your-project-id.web.app/en/studio?tenderId=tender_004&tool=audio-overview
```

### Method 2: Click Navigation
1. Go to `https://your-project-id.web.app/en/studio?tenderId=tender_004`
2. Click the Audio Overview card (purple icon, top-left)
3. All features will load

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting 404s:

1. **Check Firebase Project ID**
   ```bash
   firebase projects:list
   firebase use your-project-id
   ```

2. **Verify Build Output**
   ```bash
   ls -la out/
   ls -la out/en/
   ls -la out/en/studio/
   ```

3. **Check Firebase Console**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Hosting
   - Check deployment logs
   - Verify files are uploaded

4. **Clear Firebase Cache**
   ```bash
   firebase hosting:channel:delete live
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "Page not found" on all routes
**Solution**: Check that `firebase.json` rewrites are correct

**Issue**: Audio Overview not loading
**Solution**: Verify the component is imported correctly in the static build

**Issue**: Assets not loading (CSS/JS)
**Solution**: Check that `trailingSlash: true` is set in Next.js config
