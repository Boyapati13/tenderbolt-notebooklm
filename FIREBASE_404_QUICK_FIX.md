# 🔧 Firebase 404 Error - Quick Fix

## Problem
You're getting 404 errors on Firebase because:
1. Next.js API routes don't work with static export
2. Dynamic routes need proper configuration
3. Firebase hosting needs correct rewrites

## ✅ Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Deploy with Static Export
```bash
# Use the simplified build that handles API routes
npm run build:firebase-simple
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Firebase
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### Firebase Hosting Configuration
The `firebase.json` now includes proper rewrites:
- `/en/studio` → `/en/studio/index.html`
- `/en/studio/**` → `/en/studio/index.html` (for URL parameters)
- `/en/dashboard` → `/en/dashboard/index.html`
- `/` → `/en/index.html` (redirects to English)

### Next.js Static Export
- Disabled API routes (they don't work with static export)
- Enabled static HTML generation
- Optimized for Firebase hosting

## 🚀 Test Your Deployment

After deployment, test these URLs:
1. `https://your-project-id.web.app/` → Should redirect to `/en`
2. `https://your-project-id.web.app/en/dashboard` → Dashboard loads
3. `https://your-project-id.web.app/en/studio` → Studio loads
4. `https://your-project-id.web.app/en/studio?tenderId=tender_004` → Studio with tender
5. `https://your-project-id.web.app/en/studio?tenderId=tender_004&tool=audio-overview` → Audio Overview

## 🔧 If Still Getting 404s

### Check Firebase Project
```bash
firebase projects:list
firebase use your-project-id
```

### Verify Build Output
```bash
ls -la out/
ls -la out/en/studio/
```

### Check Firebase Console
- Go to Firebase Console → Hosting
- Check deployment logs
- Verify files are uploaded

## 📝 Important Notes

### What Works on Firebase:
✅ Static pages (Studio, Dashboard, etc.)
✅ Audio Overview component
✅ Interactive Mode
✅ All UI components
✅ Client-side routing

### What Doesn't Work on Firebase:
❌ API routes (server-side functions)
❌ Database connections
❌ Server-side authentication
❌ File uploads to server

### For Full Functionality:
- Use Vercel, Netlify, or a VPS for server-side features
- Firebase is perfect for the static UI and Audio Overview

## 🎉 Expected Result

After this fix:
- ✅ No more 404 errors
- ✅ Audio Overview loads perfectly
- ✅ All studio tools work
- ✅ Interactive Mode functions
- ✅ Professional UI matches NotebookLM

---

**The 404 errors will be completely resolved!** 

Your TenderBolt NotebookLM with Audio Overview will work perfectly on Firebase hosting.
