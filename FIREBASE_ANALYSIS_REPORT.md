- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Database connections
- Authentication servers
- File uploads
- Server-side processing

### ✅ Supported

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended) ⭐
**Best for Next.js applications**
- ✅ Full Next.js support
- ✅ API routes work
- ✅ NextAuth works
- ✅ Database connections
- ✅ Zero configuration
- ✅ Free tier available

**Deploy:**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Firebase Functions + Hosting
**Keep using Firebase ecosystem**
- ✅ Server-side code in Functions
- ✅ Static assets in Hosting
- ⚠️ More complex setup
- ⚠️ Higher cost

**Deploy:**
```bash
# Setup Firebase Functions
node firebase-functions-deploy.js
firebase deploy
```

### Option 3: Static Site (Limited)
**Firebase Hosting only**
- ✅ Works with Firebase
- ❌ No server features
- ❌ Limited functionality

**Deploy:**
```bash
# Create static version
node firebase-static-deploy.js
firebase deploy
```

## Recommendations

### For Full Functionality
**Use Vercel** - It's specifically designed for Next.js and provides:
- Native support for all Next.js features
- Automatic deployments from Git
- Global CDN
- Built-in analytics
- Zero configuration required

### For Firebase Ecosystem
**Use Firebase Functions** - If you must use Firebase:
- Deploy server-side code as Functions
- Use Hosting for static assets
- More complex but keeps you in Firebase ecosystem

### For Static Only
**Use Static Export** - If you can live without server features:
- Convert to static site
- Use external services for backend
- Fast loading but limited functionality

## Test Results

### Static Export Test
✅ Build successful

### Compatibility Check
❌ Incompatible with static export

## Next Steps

1. **Choose deployment option** based on your needs
2. **Set up environment variables** for your chosen platform
3. **Deploy and test** the application
4. **Monitor performance** and user experience
