# Firebase Deployment Issues Analysis

## Problem Summary
The application works perfectly in development mode but fails when deployed to Firebase because:

1. **Static Export Limitation**: Firebase Hosting only supports static files, but the app has:
   - API routes (`/api/*`)
   - NextAuth server-side authentication
   - Database connections (Prisma)
   - Server-side rendering

2. **NextAuth Configuration**: NextAuth requires server-side processing that doesn't work with static export

3. **Database Access**: Prisma database connections don't work in static export mode

## Solutions Available

### Option 1: Firebase Functions + Hosting (Recommended)
Deploy the full Next.js app using Firebase Functions for server-side code and Firebase Hosting for static assets.

### Option 2: Vercel (Easiest)
Deploy to Vercel which natively supports Next.js with all features.

### Option 3: Static Export with External APIs
Convert to a static site with external API services.

## Recommended Solution: Firebase Functions + Hosting

This approach will:
- Keep all existing functionality
- Use Firebase Functions for API routes
- Use Firebase Hosting for static assets
- Maintain NextAuth functionality
- Keep database connections working
