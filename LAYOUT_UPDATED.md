# ✅ Layout Updated & New Team Member Feature Added!

## 🎯 What Changed:

### 1. **Layout Swapped! (Projects ↔ Team Members)**

The Management page layout has been reorganized:

#### **Before:**
```
[Team Members List]     [Project Details]
     (left)                 (right)
```

#### **After (NEW):**
```
[Project List]          [Team Members & Details]
   (left)                      (right)
```

This matches your screenshot layout perfectly!
