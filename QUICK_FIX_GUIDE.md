# ðŸš€ Quick Fix Guide - Development Server

## âœ… **FIXED!** Your development server is now working!

### ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status**
- âœ… Development server running on `http://localhost:3002`
- âœ… Dashboard accessible at `http://localhost:3002/en/dashboard`
- âœ… Studio accessible at `http://localhost:3002/en/studio?tenderId=tender_004`
- âœ… Audio Overview working with all features

### ðŸ”§ **What Was Fixed**
1. **Configuration Conflict**: The server was using Firebase config (`output: 'export'`) in development mode
2. **Middleware Error**: Static export doesn't support middleware
3. **Turbopack Issues**: Configuration conflicts with experimental features

### ðŸ“‹ **How to Use Going Forward**

#### **For Development (Current)**
```bash
# Server is already running, but if you need to restart:
npm run dev

# Or switch to development config explicitly:
npm run config:dev
npm run dev
```

#### **For Firebase Deployment**
```bash
# Build and deploy to Firebase:
npm run deploy:firebase

# Or step by step:
npm run config:firebase
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### ðŸŽ¯ **Test Your Application**

**Open these URLs in your browser:**
1. **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3002/en/dashboard`
2. **Studio**: `http://localhost:3002/en/studio?tenderId=tender_004`
3. **Audio Overview**: `http://localhost:3002/en/studio?tenderId=tender_004&tool=audio-overview`

### ðŸ”„ **Configuration Management**

The new `switch-config.js` script helps you manage different configurations:

- **Development Mode**: Full features, API routes, middleware
- **Firebase Mode**: Static export, no API routes, optimized for hosting

### ðŸŽ‰ **Everything Working!**

Your TenderBolt NotebookLM application is now fully functional with:
- âœ… Professional NotebookLM-style UI
- âœ… Audio Overview with Interactive Mode
- âœ… All 6 studio tools
- âœ… Firebase deployment ready
- âœ… No more 404 errors
