# ✅ FIXED: Only Submission Deadline Now

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before:
The system extracted **ALL deadlines** from the document:
- Submission deadline
- Project kickoff dates
- Implementation milestones
- UAT dates
- Go-live dates
- Support period dates

**Result**: Too much information, hard to see the important date.

### Now:
The system extracts **ONLY the tender submission deadline**:
- ✅ Deadline for submitting the tender/bid/proposal
- ❌ No project timelines
- ❌ No implementation dates
- ❌ No milestone dates

**Result**: Clean, focused, actionable information.

## 📋 Example

### Old Output:
```
Deadlines:
Deadline for request for additional information: 5th October 2025 09:30 | 
Last date for additional information: 10th October 2025 09:30 | 
Deadline for Submission of Tenders: 22nd October 2025 09:30 | 
Tender Opening Session: 22nd October 2025 10:00 | 
Implementation: sixteen (16) months from contract signing | 
Support: thirty-six (36) months | 
Project Kick-off: within 2 weeks | 
Business Requirements: Month 2-3 | 
System Development: Month 8-10 | 
Internal Testing: Month 11 | 
UAT: Month 12-13 | 
Training: Month 13-14 | 
Go-Live: Month 14-16
```
**Too cluttered!** 😩

### New Output:
```
Submission Deadline:
22nd October 2025 09:30 CEST
```
**Perfect!** ✨

## 🎨 UI Update

The label also changed from "Deadlines" to **"Submission Deadline"** to be more specific.

### Banner Display:
