## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Date Parsing Error ✅
**Error**: `Invalid Date` when parsing deadline strings  
**Fix**: Added try-catch with validation before setting deadline

### Issue 2: Summary Hidden ✅
**Problem**: Summary only visible on document hover  
**Solution**: Auto-post summary as AI message in chat after upload

### Issue 3: Chat Not Updating ✅
**Problem**: Chat didn't refresh after upload  
**Solution**: Page auto-reloads 1.5 seconds after successful upload

## 💡 Tips

- **Summary is permanent**: Saved in chat history
- **You can scroll back**: See all past summaries
- **Ask follow-up questions**: "Expand on the budget section"
- **Gap analysis**: Upload supporting docs, then ask "Show gap analysis"
